The attacking creature must succeed a {@dc 15} Strength saving throw or be {@condition restrained} by the rock clone. The rock clone has an AC of 17 and 20 hit points. A creature can attempt to free a {@condition restrained} creature by using an action within 5 ft. of the {@condition restrained} creature to repeat the saving throw."

					"The asclepius does not kill so much as it breeds murder. It modus operandi is typically to disguise itself as a human or faunus and infiltrate a community. Once inside it will attempt to build trust with regular communication and interactions, but will occassionally sidestep this by killing an inhabitant and taking their place. At the same time, it begins sowing distrust with the use of illusions and lies, turning the inhabitants against one another.",
					"This will continue until it believes the inhabitants are all paranoid and fearful, at which point it will take control of an inhabitant and force them to kill. If tensions are sufficiently high enough, this may trigger a mass panic, leading to more attacks, as neighbor attacks neighbor and blood flows in the streets. The asclepius may use the confusion to attack inhabitants on its own, but usually prefers to watch from a safe vantage point to not get caught up in the chaos.",
					"Those who witness the asclepius when it is not in disguise say it reminds them of a thing that does not seem to belong but cannot be denied, a force of revolution."
